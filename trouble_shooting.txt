	adloud release sent to DFRC (10/3/2005)

	trying to compile (Sept/Oct 2006)

Wrong make file (ZIP file included in the zip file was the MATLAB version;
	should have been makefile.txt in C:\Booms\ADL\Monster_release

ZIP file from me to Ed to Larry at DFRC had wrong end-of-line characters.

ZIP file from ftp site had to be downloaded with the bin option.

variable names ending in $ had to be changed (replaced $ with _lc).

	accept *,variable 
had to be replaced with 
	read (*,*) variable


read_wsmr.f contains the lines

        open (unit=iunit,
     $    file=file$,status='old',form='formatted',readonly,
     $    err=8000)

Some Fortrans don't like "readonly"; the code compiles if you delete 
"readonly" completely.  Now if you do that, depending on your Fortran 
it may or may not open the file for reading or maybe for writing so it 
may overwrite whatever was there (this may occur if you're reading in 
data from a file) so initially you may want to ensure you have backup 
copies of files you want to analyse before you let this program loose 
on them.

In F90, the following should work:
        open (unit=iunit,
     $    file=file$,status='old',form='formatted',action='read',
     $    err=8000)

But in F90, 
	accept *,variable_name
has to be replaced with 
	read (*,*) variable_name
as we had above.

Problem in sub_loud_large_windowed.f - if the signal is too short to 
allow for any tapering, so the taper length was 0, the program would 
crash.  I've fixed this so the taper length is 1 and a message to this
effect is printed out. 

F90 had major problems with print statements in read_wsmr.f so we gave
up on opening the data file for "readonly".  F77 appears to have no 
protection (at least in the fortran Larry is running).

Updated makefile (makefile_windowed.txt) and sub_loud_large_windowed.f
put in the ZIP file.  As is read_me2.txt.
